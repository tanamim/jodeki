## Introduction
Searching online becomes de facto standard when we seek information. Although online search engines provide a great deal of information, what we see is free content from the surface of the public web. We may want to seek for deeper knowledge from private sources by paying fees. We may hire professionals but finding good information with small budget is difficult. Our service aims to fill the gap by creating a platform that people can find better-than-free content by paying small amount of fees. Blockchain technology has made our service available by executing smart contracts with much lower operational costs.

Our service is based on a hypothesis that if one knowledge is useful for somebody, others may also need it. We make it measurable by cryptocurrency and store it on blockchain so that smart contracts can exchange knowledge without central controller. Thereby we built a decentralized autonomous knowledge exchange. We use Ether (ETH) as cryptocurrency on Ethereum blockchain to run our smart contracts written by Solidity programming language. The knowledge base will be built on the blockchain via question-and-answer method.

The key feature is our incentive structure that benefits both those who ask questions and those who provide answers. For the first round, a questioner sets fee amount and post a question, then choose a winner to pay. Thereafter, when a new user pays for the answer, both the questioner and the provider will get the split fee. This operation keeps going as long as the smart contract is enabled. In this way, questioners will benefit as well as providers because we believe both are equally important contributors to the knowledge base. This unique incentive model encourages participants to improve quality of the knowledge. You don't need to have special knowledge to get reward upon our service. Just ask a great question.

## Higher Level Understanding of Current Issue
Upon creating this service we mean to propose a solution to higher level social issue that modern people got trapped into. One of the greatest problem we are facing is harsh realities of life. Since we invented money system, our society achieved great economic advancement; however, on the other hand, people are so caught up in the currency system and not being able to live without money. Because of the system, people are religiously obsessed with making money and forget the purpose of their life. This is a sad social plague that we want to cure.

What really matters is the fact that making money is too difficult. We believe that human beings are valuable by nature without money, and that we can always create new value. Because such value is not measurable and cannot be stored, we have to spend tremendous amount of energy to convert it into money. However, the rise of blockchain and cryptocurrency shed light on the problem of the current money system; thus, we offer a solution to remove obstacles to making money by applying this new technology.

## Our Mission
We believe humans can gain valuable knowledge from experience anytime and anywhere. However, it is often invisible and volatile, therefore has no value to other people. Our mission is to minimize the energy of confining your knowledge into money by enabling it to be measurable, storable, and reusable. If we can store such a volatile value and exchange with money easily, we don't need to concern too much about future livelihood because we can generate money when necessary. We envision that one day, the fear of losing life with a paucity of money will become a thing of the past. When people don't need lots of energy for value exchange, they finally became free from obsession with money, therefore start pursuing what they really want to achieve in their life. Consequently, blockchain and cryptocurrency enable us to upgrade the money system. Through which, our application aims to empower humanity to make our life peaceful, joyful, and fulfilled.

## Our Strategy
Our service is, in a nutshell, a question-and-answer style market place where users can buy and sell knowledge. The significant characteristic is its buyer-led culture. In the standard business procedure, a seller finds a business opportunity and creates products and distribute them to buyers. The leadership of the business such as when to start, when to stop, how much to receive is on the seller side. However, in our service, the leadership is on the buyer side. For example, a knowledge buyer finds a business opportunity and ask a question by offering price to get an answer. Then, the answer will be redistributed to future buyers by the smart contract. The contract will keep generating revenue until the original buyer stops it. Therefore, we want to treat information have-nots to be the leading player.

We have unique incentive structure to maintain high quality knowledge base. In terms of fee distribution, we charge 15% from each transaction to improve service quality. For the first round, the answer provider will receive 85%. From the second round thereafter, 85% will be split into halves, therefore the answer provider and the original buyer will receive 42.5% each for contributing to the knowledge base. Through those conditions we motivate participants to generate returns over the long run, and create well-intended atmosphere such that:

1. Users want to ask a question in a way that many people also want to know the answer.
2. Users want to provide their best answer in a way that many people can understand.
3. Users want to use this service as early as possible to gain first-mover advantage.

Before blockchain and cryptocurrency, there existed businesses that buyer can decide prices such as consulting or building a house. However, those business are designed to be one-to-one relationship, there's no chance of profit scaling that one-to-many relationship has. Therefore, buyer-led business for small fund such as one dollar was unthinkable. Now we made it possible with those new technologies––we reduce operational costs dramatically and let smart contracts work for us. Our incentive model enables extending one-to-one topology to one-to-many, allowing scale-up revenue creation.

## Our Position
Since our platform is decentralized, user's money, the knowledge base, and smart contracts are not stored in our proprietary server. In this way, we ruled out the risk of being hacked, because there's no single point of failure. At the worst case, cyberattack might be able to shut down our application server. However, users assets will be secured on the blockchain and they can use our service without problem through the client app installed in their smartphones and computers.

In addition to the security benefits, there are dramatic cost reduction. Our smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum network and executes functions such as sending money or retrieving information with very low cost (i.e., estimated less than 10 cents as of 23 Jun 2018). If we don't use blockchain, the costs of application server and database server, security hardening grow rapidly as number of users increases.

Our primary purpose is not generating profits. Rather, we want to maximize client's benefit. Hence, we aim to provide another source of income and wisdom at their hand, to help users achieve self-realization. Since we are different from economic enterprise, our position in the market is unique. We are not looking for external investors, nor income from ads. Instead, we are looking for participants; therefore, our growth strategy is bootstrap method relying on the size and activity of our user community.

Similar services already exist, but those are different from our service: Most companies provide information from the surface web, also their revenue model is mainly from ads (Google, StackOverflow, Quora, Yahoo! Answers). Yours is a blockchain-based messaging board with paywall, but it's business is seller-led style.

Our knowledge base aims to be more valuable than google's database––it is possible because our data is collected from private source. [This research](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0007.104?view=text;rgn=main) authored by Michael K. Bergman titled *The Deep Web: Surfacing Hiden Value* shows that private source has 500 times more data and many times greater quality compared to the surface web.

## Our Service
A sample user who asks a hundred of one-dollar-worth questions and each acquires ten buyers in the first month they will receive 325 dollars value of ETH`($-1 * 100 + $1 * 100 * 10 * 0.425 = $325)`. If no additional questions are made but there are ten buyers in the second month, they will receive 425 dollars value of ETH`($1 * 100 * 10 * 0.425 = $425)`. In more successful case, a highly reputable questioner who ask a hundred-dollar-question and acquire thousand buyers will receive 42,400 dollars value of ETH`($-100 + $100 * 1000 * 0.425 = $42,400)`. We never know how valuable knowledge we can obtain from our participants, but we are very excited to launch the service to see interesting questions and answers.

The usage is quite simple. Just go to [Jodeki.com]() and create a user account and save an Ethereum addreess for pay and receive Ether. Then you can start asking a question from the browser or smartphones/desktop applications you can download from the website.
