White Paper: A Decentralized Autonomous Knowledge Exchange
===
## Executive Summary <!-- omit in toc -->
Jodeki *[ʤoʊdəki]*, meaning "good job" in Japanese, is a platform that offers knowledge exchange service over decentralized network. It is also a name of the service itself, driven by an ambitious and altruistic endeavor to tackle two major problems in modern society: 1) skewed information on the Internet fueled by ads, and 2) difficulty of earning a livelihood under the current money system. By applying blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, Jodeki invented a unique incentive structure to bring solutions to those concerns through its knowledge exchange service. Since blockchain technology is encapsulated, users can use this service without thinking about the technology.

## Introduction

###### A Gap Between Public and Private Information
Searching online has become the de facto standard when we seek information. Although online search engines provide a great deal of information, what we see is free content from the surface of the public web. We may want to seek for deeper knowledge from private sources by paying fees. We may hire professionals but finding good information with small budget is difficult. Our service aims to fill the gap by creating a platform that people can find better-than-free content by paying small amount of fees. Thanks to blockchain technology, dramatic cost reduction has been made, allowing our service become possible.

###### Attractive Reward System
All participants can benefit from our service. The key feature is our incentive structure that benefits both those who ask questions and those who provide answers. For the first round, a questioner sets fee amount and post a question, then choose a winner to pay. Thereafter, when a new user pays for the answer, both the questioner and the provider will get the split fee. This operation keeps going as long as the smart contract is enabled. In this way, questioners will benefit as well as answerers because we believe both are equally important contributors to the knowledge base. This unique reward system encourages participants to improve quality of the knowledge. You don't need to have special knowledge to get reward upon our service. Of course, no blockchain knowledge is required. Just ask a great question.

###### Technologies Under the Hood
Our service is based on a hypothesis that if knowledge is useful for somebody, others may also need it, too. Our aim is to create a string of knowledge measurable and transferrable via the use of cryptocurrency, which is a digital currency used on the Internet as a medium of exchange. Encryption techniques are utilized to generate and regulate different units of such currency. And these encryption techniques also have the ability to verify the transfer of funds. Once a transaction is complete, knowledge, which will be stored on blockchain, can be easily transferred. Thereby we built a decentralized autonomous knowledge exchange. We use Ether (ETH) as cryptocurrency on Ethereum blockchain to run our smart contracts. Smart contracts can operate on blockchain and securely execute its program with very low cost, therefore we use them to reduce security and operational costs. Jodeki uses smart contracts to build knowledge base on the blockchain via question-and-answer method. Since those technical details are encapsulated, users don't need to know more than this information, in order to use our service.

## Our Mission

###### Better Search
We want to provide high quality search functions by ads-free private information retrieval. Since most public web services implement ads for monetization at the expence of contents quality, the Internet search results can be skewed towards ads. We removed ads and allow users to get information from private sources with a little fees and make Internet search more efficient. We designed attractive incentive mechanism to encourage users to provide knowledge at their best.

###### Emancipation from Obsession with Money
We believe humans can gain valuable knowledge from experience anytime and anywhere. However, it is often invisible and volatile, therefore has no value to other people. Our mission is to minimize the energy of confining your knowledge into money by enabling it to be measurable, storable, and reusable. If we can store such a volatile value and exchange with money easily, we don't need to concern too much about future livelihood because we can generate money when necessary. We envision that one day, the fear of losing life with a paucity of money will become a thing of the past. When people don't need lots of energy for value exchange, they finally become free from obsession with money, therefore start pursuing what they really want to achieve in their life. Consequently, blockchain and cryptocurrency enable us to upgrade the money system. Through which, our application aims to empower humanity to make our life peaceful, joyful, and fulfilled.

## Our Strategy

###### Seller-led vs Buyer-led Culture
Our service is, in a nutshell, a question-and-answer style market place where users can buy and sell knowledge. The significant characteristic is its buyer-led culture. In the standard business procedure, a seller finds a business opportunity and creates products and distribute them to buyers. The leadership of the business such as when to start, when to stop, how much to receive is on the seller side. However, in our service, the leadership is on the buyer side. For example, a knowledge buyer finds a business opportunity and ask a question by offering price to get an answer. Then, the answer will be redistributed to future buyers by the smart contract. The contract will keep generating revenue until the original buyer stops it. Therefore, we want to treat information have-nots to be the leading player.

###### Incentive Structure
We have unique incentive structure to maintain high quality knowledge base. In terms of fee distribution, we charge 15% from each transaction to improve service quality. For the first round, the answer provider will receive 85%. From the second round thereafter, 85% will be split into halves, therefore the answer provider and the original buyer will receive 42.5% each for contributing to the knowledge base. Through those conditions we motivate participants to generate returns over the long run, and create well-intended atmosphere such that:

1. Users want to ask a question in a way that many people also want to know the answer.
2. Users want to provide their best answer in a way that many people can understand.
3. Users want to use this service as early as possible to gain first-mover advantage.

###### Revitalizing Buyer-led Business
Before blockchain and cryptocurrency, there existed businesses that buyer can decide prices such as consulting or house building. However, those businesses are designed to be (ⅱ) one-to-one relationship, there's no chance of profit scaling that (ⅰ) one-to-many relationship has. Therefore, buyer-led business for small fund such as one dollar was unthinkable. Now we made it possible with those new technologies––we reduce operational costs dramatically and let smart contracts work for us. Our incentive model enables extending one-to-one topology to (ⅲ) one-to-many, allowing scale-up revenue creation.

## Our Position

###### Securing User Assets
Since our platform is decentralized, users' money, the knowledge base, and the smart contracts are not stored in our proprietary server. In this way, we ruled out the risk of being hacked, because there's no single point of failure. At the worst case, cyberattack might be able to shut down our application server. However, users' assets will be secured on the blockchain and they can use our service without problem through the client app installed in their smartphones and computers.

###### Feasibility Assessment
In addition to the security benefits, there are dramatic cost reduction. Our smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum network and executes functions such as sending money or retrieving information with very low cost (i.e., estimated less than 10 cents as of 23 Jun 2018). If we don't use blockchain, the costs of application server and database server, security hardening grow rapidly as number of users increases.

###### Altruism
Our primary purpose is not generating profits. Rather, we want to maximize client's benefit. Hence, we aim to provide another source of income and wisdom at their hand, to help users achieve self-realization. Since we are different from economic enterprise, our position in the market is unique. We are not looking for external investors, nor income from ads. Instead, we are looking for participants; therefore, our growth strategy is bootstrap method relying on the size and activity of our user community.

###### Quality of Knowledge
Our knowledge base aims to be more valuable than Google's database––it is possible because our data is collected from private source. [This research](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0007.104?view=text;rgn=main) authored by Michael K. Bergman titled *The Deep Web: Surfacing Hidden Value* shows that private source has 500 times more data and many times greater quality compared to the surface web.

###### Differentiation Factors
Similar services already exist, but those are different from our service. Most companies provide information from the surface web, also their revenue model is mainly from ads (Google, StackOverflow, Quora, Yahoo! Answers). "Yours" is a blockchain-based messaging board with paywall, but its business is seller-led style.

## Our Service

###### User Income Simulations
A sample questioner A asks a hundred of one-dollar-worth questions and each acquires ten buyers in the first month, they will receive 325 dollars value of ether `($-1 * 100 + $1 * 100 * 10 * 0.425 = $325)`. If no additional questions are made but there are ten more buyers in the second month, they will receive 425 dollars value of ether `($1 * 100 * 10 * 0.425 = $425)`. In more successful case, a highly reputable questioner B asks a hundred-dollar-worth question that acquires one thousand buyers, they will receive 42,400 dollars value of ether `($-100 + $100 * 1000 * 0.425 = $42,400)`. Questioners and answerers can both increase rewards by optimizing questions price, number of questions and answers, and number of sales. 

| Name-Month | Avg Price | Num Q&A | Num Sold | Reward Rate | Reward  |
| :--------: | --------: | ------: | -------: | :---------: | ------: |
| A-1        | $1        | 100     | 10       | 42.5%       | $325    |
| A-2        | -         | -       | 10       | 42.5%       | $425    |
| B-1        | $100      | 1       | 1000     | 42.5%       | $42,400 |

###### Instruction Free User Experience
We designed our service to be intuitively obvious. Since all the complicated technology is encapsulated, no blockchain knowledge is needed. The usage is essentially the same as posting a message on twitter. Just go to [Jodeki.com]() and create a user account and save an Ethereum addreess to pay and receive Ether. Then you are all set. Let's start asking a questions or answering to a question from your browser or smartphones/desktop applications that you download from the website.
